	<h2 class="mb-2">Activities</h2>
	<p class="mb-5">
		Axis Prisoners of war participated in three different activities during their stay in America. They had recreation time, work, and reeducation program. Activities were different at each camp, which each camp page will go into more depth about. Activities such as recreation helped to boost the morale of the prisoners and let them enjoy their time when they weren’t working. Labor was dependent on the Geneva Conventions which outlined what the prisoners were allowed to do. The reeducation program was designed to promote democracy in the Nazis and Americans where their governments were not democratic.

	<h2 class="mb-2">Recreational Activities</h2>
	<p class="mb-5">
		Recreational activities included theatre, sports and games, and educational activities such as classes or taking part in a newspaper called Der Ruf (The Call, when translated) that the prisoners made to ship to other prisoner camps. The prisoners were allowed to put on theatre shows for themselves or American civilians, but not for American soldiers. The Geneva Convention required the sports equipment, musical instruments, and books for recreation.  would be available to prisoners. The YMCA War Prisoners Aid organized sports and other recreational activities for the POWs to take part in. In the indoor activities center, prisoners could play games such as chess, checkers, cards, or work on arts and crafts projects. 

		In a labor camp in Suffolk, VA, the prisoners would sit on top of the building where they lived and watch the nearby high school’s football game on Friday nights. Most prisoners with favorite past times were able to practice them while in the camps in America. Some who enjoyed gardening took part in camp beautification projects. Americans arranged for prisoners to take classes in camps that earned them high-school equivalent degrees, and take tests to determine their capability in a career that allowed them to go onto a professional school when they returned to Europe. Classes choices were very diverse and prisoners had the opportunity to learn German, English, French, Latin, and skilled courses such as bookkeeping, automobile mechanics, and bookbinding. Another educational activity was the newspaper, Der Ruf which reported war news and general topics, including a critique on American Architecture. Prisoners who had been journalists before the or just wanted to learn the trade took part in this in Fort Kearny, Rhode Island.
